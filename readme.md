### Technologies

The Web Developer extension is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Extension documentation

For information about how to write browser extensions check out the Chrome, Firefox, and Opera documentation:

* Chrome: [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/)
* Edge: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/)
* Firefox: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons)
* Opera: [https://dev.opera.com/extensions/](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/)

### Build process

The extension uses the [Gulp build system](https://gulpjs.com/).

Once Gulp is installed the extension is built by running the following:

	gulp

To build the extension for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Opera only run `gulp chrome`, `gulp edge`, `gulp firefox`, or `gulp opera` respectively.

When the extension is built it creates `build/chrome`, `build/edge`, `build/firefox`, and `build/opera` directories as well as packaged versions of the extensions `build/web-developer-chrome.zip`, `build/web-developer-edge.zip`, `build/web-developer-firefox.xpi`, and `build/web-developer-opera.nex`.

The extension can be installed in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Opera by loading the unpacked extension in `build/chrome`, `build/edge`, `build/firefox`, or `build/opera` respectively as described in the [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked), [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading), [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#trying_it_out), and [Opera](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/) documentation.
